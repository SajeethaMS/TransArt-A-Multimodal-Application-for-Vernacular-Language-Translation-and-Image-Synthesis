TransArt: A Multimodal Application for Vernacular Language Translation and Image Synthesis
Project Overview
TransArt is a web-based application designed to translate text from Tamil to English and then generate relevant images based on the translated text. This project aims to showcase the seamless integration of language translation and creative AI to produce visual content from textual descriptions.

Features
Text Translation: Translates text inputs from Tamil to English using a neural machine translation model.
Image Generation: Generates images based on the translated English text using a text-to-image model.
Creative Content Creation: Produces creative written content based on the translated text, enriching the multimedia content offering.

Problem Statement
Develop a web-based application that:

Translates text from Tamil to English using a neural machine translation model.
Generates images based on the translated English text using a text-to-image model.
Produces creative written content based on the same or separate translated text.
Objective
Deploy a pre-trained or fine-tuned model using Hugging Face Spaces or AWS services, making it accessible through a web application built with Streamlit or Gradio.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
